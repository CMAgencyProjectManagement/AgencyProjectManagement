            In the advertising, digital or marketing sectors, the creative team is responsible for generating attention-grabbing ideas
            that will entice the consumer or target audience. Members of the team work together to develop conceptual campaigns
            designed to stand apart from competitors.
            <br/> The creative team usually consists of an established art director and a copywriter, with some companies looking
            for individuals who have both skill sets. However, other members involved can include web developers and editors.
            <br/> Members of this team need to be confident enough to share and sell their ideas, and perceptive enough to know
            when to encourage others to share theirs. Team members should also be strategic in their thinking, so they can
            organise thoughts and develop plans to suit the expectations of the client.
            <br/> Creativity is all about nurturing imagination and turning thoughts into the ideas that give a project the edge.
            So agencies will expect team members to have a positive approach that encourages their creativity to flourish.
